`rinex-cli` is a command line application based off the RINEX crate,
to manage RINEX files (like reshaping or mixing), but also perform geodesic calculations,
analyze broadcast ephemeris, estimate differential code biases etc..

It can also generate an html report that is similar to "teqc" QC mode.

## File loading interface

`rinex-cli` accepts one primary file and possible context enhancers.

In basic operations, only a primary file is expected.  
Some RINEX files can only serve as primary files too.  
Refer to [this page](doc/file-combination.md) to understand
what data context you should provide for the analysis you want to perform.

In any case: 

- `--fp` (`-f`) only accepts one file at the moment
- `--nav`, `--sp3` and similar context enhancer,
accept both directories and individual files.

To load several files, use the command line flag once per file, for example :

```bash
./target/release/rinex-cli \
    --fp /tmp/PRIMARY.txt \
    --nav /foo/NAV1.txt \
    --nav /tmp/NAV2.txt
```

You can stack as many as you want.

This also applies to directories, for example : 

```bash
./target/release/rinex-cli \
    --fp /tmp/PRIMARY.txt \
    --nav /foo/NAV_DIR1 \
    --nav /tmp/NAV_DIR2
```

When loading a specific data type, we expect the directory to only contain this type of data.  
For example when loading --nav, we only Navigation data. Other types of data will not be loaded.

Directories loading is recursive. that means rinex-cli works particularly well if you sort your data
on file types and constellations. For example :

```
POOL/2023/100/OBS/
POOL/2023/100/SP3/
POOL/2023/100/NAV/
POOL/2023/101/OBS/
POOL/2023/101/SP3/
POOL/2023/101/NAV/
```

Or even better: 

```
POOL/2023/100/OBS/
POOL/2023/100/SP3/
POOL/2023/100/NAV/GPS/
POOL/2023/100/NAV/BEIDOU/
POOL/2023/100/NAV/GALILEO/
POOL/2023/101/SP3/GPS/
POOL/2023/101/SP3/BEIDOU/
POOL/2023/101/SP3/GALILEO/
```

## File naming conventions

File names are disregarded by this tool, you can parse & analyze
files that do not follow naming conventions.

## Compressed data

CRINEX (V1 and V3) are natively supported. That means you can load
compressed Observation Data directly.  

This tool supports gzip compressed files but their names must be terminated by `.gz`
so we can determine a first decompression is needed.

### Analysis and reporting

Reports and plots are rendered in HTML in the `rinex/rinex-cli/workspace` directory.  
Analysis is named after the primary RINEX file.

## `teqc` operations

`teqc` is a well known application to process RINEX files.   
Unlike teqc, this application is not capable of processing Binary RINEX ("BINEX") and 
proprietary formats in general.

Some teqc operations are supported:

- [merge](doc/merge.md): Merge two RINEX files together
- [split](doc/split.md): Split a RINEX file into two
- [resampling](doc/preprocessing.md): Resampling operations can be performed 
if you know how to operate the preprocessing toolkit
- [quality check](doc/qc.md): RINEX data quality analysis (mainly statistics and only on OBS RINEX at the moment)
- other advanced operations are documented in the [processing](doc/processing.md) suite

## Getting started

Download the latest release for your architecture 
[from the release portal](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/releases).

Or compile the application manually:

```shell
cargo build --all-features --release
```

The program is located in  "target/release/rinex-cli",
which we might simply refer in some examples as `rinex-cli`.

All examples depicted in this documentation suite uses our
[test data](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/tree/main/test_resources).  
That means you have everything to reproduce the provided examples on your side. 

## Command line interface

Refer to the help menu which provides extensive explanations:

```bash
./target/release/rinex-cli -h
```

File paths always have to be absolute.   
Arguments order does not matter to this application: 

```bash
rinex-cli --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz
rinex-cli --sv-epoch --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz 
```

Use the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to setup the logger.
Set the sensitivy as desired, "trace" being the most sensitive,
"info" the standard value:

```bash
RUST_LOG=trace rinex-cli --fp test_resources/NAV/V2/amel010.21g

export RUST_LOG=info
rinex-cli --fp test_resources/NAV/V2/amel010.21g
```

Here's an example of traces you might get on a complex run:

```bash
./target/release/rinex-cli \
    -f test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz \
        -P GPS L1C,L2L ">G18" "<=G25" \
            decim:4:L1C ">2020-06-25T08:00:00 UTC" "<=2020-06-25T10:00:00 UTC"

```

`antenna position: WGS (x, y, z)` was located in the provided context: some advanced operations are feasible.  
A few preprocessing operations were requested with `-P`, you get a trace
for every operation that did apply (correct command line description).  
`> record analysis` means the analysis is starting at this point.   
The location of the graphs that were rendered (if any) is given.

[rinex-cli/workspace](workspace/) is where all analysis reports
get generated. It is named after the main RINEX file (`-fp`) which
allows preserving sessions for different files.

Analysis are stacked to one another, and order does not matter.  

For example, when providing OBS RINEX data, 
one plot per physic is to be generated. 
In this example, we also stack two more analysis,
both of them are graphical, so two more graphs are rendered.

```bash
rinex-cli \
    --sv-epoch \ # Sv per Epoch identification
    --epoch-hist \  # sampling rate histogram analysis
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz 
```

## HTML content

The analysis report is generated in HTML.  
In the future, we will allow other formats to be generated
(like JSON). 

When the analysis is concluded, the report
is opened in the default web browser. This is turned off
if the quiet option (`-q`) is active.

The HTML content is self-sufficient, all Javascript
and other dependencies are integrated . 
This results in a large file whose rendering is quick.
To change that behavior, the `--tiny-html` option is there. 
The resulting report gets reduced (about 8 times smaller), but
graphical views (if any) are longer to render in the browser.
This is actually only true if the javascript has not been cached
by the web browser.

## Data identification

Basic Identification consists in extracting high level information to understand which 
data is contained in a given RINEX.
Examples of such information would be `Epoch` or `Sv` enumerations.

For example:

```bash
rinex-cli -f OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O --epochs
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O --epochs --sv
``` 

The `--pretty` option is there to make the datasets more readable (json format): 

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O --epochs --sv --pretty
``` 

## Data analysis

Several analysis can be stacked to the generated report, 
like `--sv-epoch` or sample rate analysis with `--epoch-hist`.   
Refer to their [dedicated page](doc/analysis.md) documentation.

## File generation

Like input files, output files do not have to follow RINEX naming conventions.  
Eventually, this tool might have a file creation helper, to help the user
follow naming conventions, but it is currenly under development.

File generation applies to all the following operations

* [preprocessing](doc/preprocessing.md): create a new RINEX from the stripped RINEX content
that results from preprocessing algorithms
* [merge](doc/merge.md): merge two files into a single RINEX
* [split](doc/split.md): split a file into two.

For example, create a file that is only made of G08 data originally contained in this file:

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz \
    -P G08 \ # see preprocessing toolkit
    --output g01.txt # does not have to follow naming conventions
```

Header section is simply copied and maintained.

### File generation and compression

It is possible compress data to .gz directly, if the specified `--output` 
is terminated by `.gz`.

It is also possible to convert Observation Data to CRINEX directly
* to CRINX1 if the specified `--output` is terminated by a standard YYd termination
* to CRINX3 if the specified `--output` is termined by `.crx`

In cases where CRINEX conversion is feasible, 
it is possible to stack the `.gz` compression on top of it
* YYd.gz to specify a CRNX1 + gz
* crx.gz to specify a CRNX3 + gz

Likewise, the mirror operations are feasible:

* extract `.gz` compressed data and dump it as readable
* extract a CRINEX and dump it as a readable RINEX

### File Header customization

A header section customization interface is currently under development.  
It is possible to pass custom header fields, one per `--output` flag,
to customize such section of the RINEX to be generated.

The `custom-header` flag accepts either a direct JSON description
of the `Rinex::Header` structure, or a local file containing
such a description.
