`rinex-cli` is a command line application to post process RINEX data.  
It can be used to reshape your RINEX files, perform basic geodesic calculations,
like broadcast ephemeris analysis and differential code bias estimation.  
It can also generate an html report that is similar to "teqc" QC mode.  
A position solver is now built-in which allows precise position solving.

contains detailed explanations and many tutorials that should get you started quickly.  
Our tutorials are compelling examples (real world applications).
