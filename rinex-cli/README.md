[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT) 

The first purpose of this tool is to expose the [library](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/rinex) 
in a high level and easy to use fashion.  
The application will be able to parse all RINEX formats supported by the library, refer to the front page to understand which RINEX format is currently supported.

The application knows a few `teqc` operations, refer to the
[dedicated paragraph](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#teqc-operations)
down below.

This tool will eventually be able to perform most common RINEX 
[post-processing](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#post-processing).

## File naming conventions

File names are disregarded by these tools, you can analyze
& parse files that do not follow naming conventions.

When producing data, this tool will eventually help the user to generate RINEX that follows
naming conventions, but that is currently under development.

### Compressed data

CRINEX (V1 and V3) are natively supported.

This tool supports gzip compressed files, as long as their name is terminated
by `.gz`.

## `teqc` operations

`teqc` is a well known application to process RINEX.  

Unlike `teqc`, this application is not capable of processing Binary RINEX ("BINEX") and 
proprietary formats in general.

Here is the list of operations that this tool is capable of performing,
that usually people use `teqc` almost exclusively to perform, to this day

- [merge](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#merge)
several RINEX together into a single file.

- [decimate](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#decimate)
RINEX record to reduce the quantity of data to analyze

- [split](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#split)
given file(s) into two

- [ascii-plot](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#ascii-plot)
to print a very descriptive tiny plot in the terminal,
as contained in reports generated by `teqc`

## Data visualization

A data visualization method is currently under development.
It is currently available only for Observation Data.
Refer to the 
[plot section](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/rinex-cli/README.md#plot)

## Getting started

This application is managed by `cargo`.

The application currently requires the following dependencies to be installed

```shell
apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev
```

Refer to the help menu to understand the command line interface.
By default, we print the command line interface:
```shell
cargo run --bin rinex-cli 
```

Arguments order does not matter for the application.   

`filepath` is the only mandatory argument, other flags are optional.

Major arguments have an abbreviation:

```bash
rinex-cli --filepath /tmp/amel010.21g
rinex-cli -f /tmp/amel010.21g
```

Some arguments support an array of values to be given.
In this case, we use a comma seperated format to describe the values.
Whitespaces are not allowed in the description

```bash
rinex-cli \
     -f test_resources/OBS/V2/rovn0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V3/DUTH0630.22O
```

## Tool philosophy

Invoke the tool against one or several files.  
Several files might be required based on the operation to perform.  
It is not recommended to combine special ops like "merge" or "diff",
to other ops.
All flags are optionnal and can be combined, expect for some special operations.  

If you request some operation, usually to inspect internal data (like `epoch` or `sv`),
the tool will not expose the record but will restrict to the requested information.

For example, this command line will expose identified epochs and vehicules

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O --epochs --sv
``` 

If no specific data or fields are requested to be displayed, then we expose the record

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O
``` 

Because RINEX files are huge and complex, we developped some filtering operations
to reduce data quantity and focus on data of interest.

`retain-` operations will only retain data of interest.
`filter-` operations will filter non interesting data.

For example this command will only retain data from specific vehicules

```bash
rinex-cli 
     -f test_resources/OBS/V2/rovn0010.21o \
        --retain-sv R03,G10
``` 

Filter operations can be stacked

```bash
rinex-cli --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/rovn0010.21o \
    --decim-interval 00:05:00 \
        --retain-sv G10
```

When specific operations are combined to filter operations,
we perform them on the filtered data content.
For instance, here requesting identified epochs in the decimated record
versus default record content:

```bash
rinex-cli --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/rovn0010.21o --epochs
rinex-cli --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/rovn0010.21o \
    --decim-interval 01:30:00 --epochs
```

## Output format

This tool uses JSON format to expose data, which makes it easy
to import into other tools. The `--pretty` argument is available
and can be combined to all existing flags, to indent the exposed data,
and make it easier to read

```bash
rinex-cli --pretty -f /tmp/amel010.21g \
      --epoch --sv-filter R01,G01 

rinex-cli -f /tmp/amel010.21g \
      --decimate-interval 00:05:00 \
            --sv-filter G01 --pretty
``` 

## Decimate

To reduce the record size, we use decimation

- either by an integer ratio
- or by a minimum epoch interval ("sampling interval") to respect

With this command, we reduce the record size by 2 :
```bash
# print initial epochs
rinex-cli --epoch --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o

# reduce by 2
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o \
    --decim-interval 00:01:00 # 1' interval, 00:00:30 epochs get dropped out

# with is actually equivalent to    
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o \
       --decim-ratio 2 # but no knowledge of the resulting "sample" rate 
```

## Signal condition filters

Observation data might have an "LLI" flag attached to them.
It is possible to apply an And() mask on this field. In this case,
all epochs that did not come with an LLI flag get also dropped out.

In this example, we focus on epochs where a `Loss of Lock` event happened

```shell
rinex-cli --pretty --lli-mask 1 --sv R01 \ 
          -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o
```

SSI field is another data field that might come with an observation
and it gives the estimated receiver power / SNR at the sampling instant.

It is possible to filter data on minimum signal strength, which
is equivalent to a data "quality" filter

With the following command, we only retain data with SSI >= 5
that means at least 30 dB SNR. 

```shell
rinex-cli --pretty -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o \
        --ssi-filter 5 --sv-filter R01
```

## Observables

It is possible to focus physics or data of interest
by using the retain-obs filter, on Observation RINEX:

```bash
# list encountered "observables"
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V3/CBW100NLD_R_20210010000_01D_MN.rnx --obs

# extract raw phase data and pseudo range only
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o  \
    --retain-obs C1,L1
```

##Â Navigation Orbits

It is possible to retain Navigation Orbits of interest,
by using the retain-orb filter.

```bash
# list encountered "observables"
rinex-cli -f test_resources/NAV/V3/CBW100NLD_R_20210010000_01D_MN.rnx \
    retain-orb cus,omega0 --pretty
```

## Post processing

Some post processing operations are being developped. People usually perform them with tools like `rtklib`.
This application does not aim at matching what `rtklib` is capable of, but it can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to similarly supported operations

## Differential RINEX

Differential RINEX is the operation rnx(a) - rnx(b) where both are Observation RINEX
assumed to be sampled by stationnary and close to each other different receivers.
This simple operation cancels out ionospheric biases.

Provide at least two OBS files for this operation to work.  
Here we differentiante zegv0010.21o using delf0010.21o.  
This is only a command line example, it does not produce anything meaningful because delf0010.21o does not share
any common epoch with zegv0010.21o

```bash
rinex-cli --diff -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V2/delf0010.21o
```

The operation is described in the API [right here](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/struct.Rinex.html#method.diff_mut).

## Double Differential RINEX

Double Differential RINEX is first a rnx(a) - rnx(b) operation, previously described,
then another differentiation where a specific satellite vehicule is defined
as reference, for a given epoch and a given constellation.
We define the reference vehicule as the one closest to zenith.
To determine such information, we need Navigation ephemeris to be provided too.

This operation requires at least 2 OBS files and 1 NAV file to be provided.
The (A) and (B) role in the `diff` operation is determined by order of appearance
of the Observation files in the command line: 
* first encountered is (A)
* last encountered is (B)

The order of appearance of the NAV file does not matter.

For example, this command will expose 
zegv0010.21o - delf0010.21o using NAV.d as reference.

```bash
rinex-cli --ddiff \
    -f zegv0010.21o,delf0010.21o,nav.d
```

But this command will also work
```bash
rinex-cli --ddiff \
    -f zegv0010.21o,nav.d,delf0010.21o
```

While this one will invert roles, and compute
del0010.21o - zegv0010.21o
```bash
rinex-cli --ddiff \
    -f delf0010.21o,zegv0010.21o,nav.d
```

Finally, requesting `ddiff` without providing Ephemeris will cause a panic:
```bash
rinex-cli --ddiff \
    -f delf0010.21o,zegv0010.21o
```

And it is possible to perform N double differentiation at once,
but we currently only support 1 reference Ephemeris to be specified
```bash
rinex-cli --ddiff \
    -f nav.d,obs_a1.o,obs_b1.o,obs_a2.o,obs_b2.o
```

Refer
[to the API](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/struct.Rinex.html#method.double_diff_mut).
for more detail about this operation.

## Cycle slips

Possible cycle slip events are described by the GNSS receiver.  
Print such information like this

```bash
rinex-cli --cycle-slips -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o
```

Cycle slips determination is under development, by adding more data processing on top of the
previously defined Double Differential RINEX algorithm.

## RTK resolution

RTK resolution (rover/base) is under development, by combining the previous double differential RINEX post processing,
and adding a Navigation data analysis on top of it.

## Merge

Merge several RINEX together. We use the `teqc` identifiers to describe the merge operation

```bash
rinex-cli -m -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o,test_resources/OBS/V2/delf0010.21o
```

This generates a new RINEX file "merged.rnx"

## `Split` special operation

It is possible to split given RINEX files into two.

`Split` has two behaviors

* (1) if given RINEX is a `merged` RINEX (either by `teqc` or this tool),
we split the record at the epoch (timestamps) where records were previously merged

* (2) otherwise, the user is expected to describe a timestamp (`epoch`) 
at which we will split the record.

### Splitting a previously merged record

```bash
# Merge two RINEX together
cargo run -f /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx -m --output /tmp/merged.rnx
# Split resulting RINEX
cargon run -f /tmp/merged.rnx --split --output /tmp/split1.rnx,/tmp/split2.rnx 
```

When splitting a merged RINEX, the header section is simply
copied into both results.

### Splitting record

If User provides an `epoch`, the tool will try to locate the
given timestamp and perform `split()` at this date & time.

Two description format are supported, for the user to describe a sampling
timestamp:

* "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" : Datetime description and EpochFlag::Ok is assumed
* "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS X" : Datetime description where X describes the EpochFlag integer value.
Refer to RINEX standards for supported Epoch flag values 

The tool identifies matching timestamp by comparing the datetime field AND
the flag field. They both must match.

Example :

```bash
# Split a previously merged record
cargo run -f /tmp/merged.rnx --split \
    --output /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx

# Split a record at specified timestamp,
# don't forget the \" encapsulation \" ;)
cargo run -f /tmp/data.rnx --split "2022-06-03 16:00:00" \
    --output /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx

# Split a record at specified timestamp with precise Power Failure event
# don't forget the \" encapsulation \" ;)
cargo run -f /tmp/data.rnx --split "2022-06-03 16:00:00 1" \
    --output /tmp/file1.rnx,/tmp/file2.rnx
```

## ascii-plot

The ascii-plot emulates the quite interesting tiny plot that `teqc` attaches to its verbose report.

The ascii plot is currently generated for every given Observation RINEX file.

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/zegv0010.21o --ascii-plot

```

Like other requests, this one cancels the record exposure, with the previous command,
a single tiny plot is to be generated.

To understand the meaning of this plot, please currently refer to the `teqc` documentation

## Data visualization

A data visualization interface is under development.  

It currently only works on Observation RINEX and can only
output a visualization for a single file.

Data visualization is requested with the `--plot` argument.  
This option will generate 4 PNG files, one per physics, 
that get populated by a plot, is related physics were measured.

Previously mentionned filters can be stacked to the plotting operation,
to focus on data of interest.

For instance, the following Carrier Phase and Signal Strength
visualization were generated with this command:

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/OBS/V2/delf0010.21o \
    --retain-sv G11,R03,G13,G15 --retain-obs L1,S1 --plot
```
