The main purpose of this tool is to expose the [library](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/rinex) 
capabilities, in a high level and easy to use interface.

## RINEX files

Several RINEX files exist. The tool support most RINEX formats, some exotic formats
are still under development, refer to the 
[main table](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/blob/main/README.md#supported-rinex-types)

### File naming conventions

File names are disregarded by this tool, you can analyze
& parse files that do not follow naming conventions.

When producing data, this tool will eventually help the user to generate RINEX that follows
naming conventions, but that is currently under development.

### Compressed data

CRINEX (V1 and V3) are natively supported.  
This tool supports gzip compressed files, as long as their name is terminated by `.gz`.

### Analysis and report files

Analysis and reports are generated in HTML, in the `rinex/rinex-cli/product` directory.  

For each session, you get a `rinex/rinex-cli/product/$PRIMARY` folder, where $PRIMARY
is the name of the `--fp`  primary RINEX file that was given to the command line.  
  
This allows generating and saving multiple reports in successive tool invokations.

## Getting started

Grab the binary for your architecture 
[from the latest release](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/releases).

Or compile the application manually:

```shell
cargo build --release
./target/release/rinex-cli -h
```

When we say "rinex-cli", we now imply "target/release/rinex-cli" - previously installed.  

All examples described here are based off our 
[test data](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/tree/main/test_resources).  
This means you have everything to reproduce the provided command lines on your side.   

## Command line interface

File paths have to be absolute. 
Arguments order does not matter to this application: 

```bash
rinex-cli --fp test_resources/NAV/V2/amel010.21g
rinex-cli --sv-epoch --fp /tmp/amel010.21g
```

`--fp` is the only mandatory flag and is how the "primary" RINEX file is given.  

In advanced modes, we'll see that other (secondary) files can be passed, to unlock
advanced operations. 

Use the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to take advantage of the logger.  
Set the sensitivy as desired, "trace" being the most sensitive,
"info" is the standard value:

```bash
RUST_LOG=trace rinex-cli --fp test_resources/NAV/V2/amel010.21g

export RUST_LOG=info
rinex-cli --fp test_resources/NAV/V2/amel010.21g
```

## HTML and analysis report

When an operation is requested, it gets added to the report
being generated. Most analysis are graphical, based on `plotly`.  

`plotly` is a powerful interface that will provide a tiny GUI for each analysis
requested. Use a double click on the legend to focus and filter out a dataset.  
Use the "export to PNG" feature to save the current view as a file.

The Quality Check (`--qc`) summary report
is a more verbose approach, where information you may get from graphs analysis
or graphs manipulation are exposed or depicted in another form.  
  
There also are information you only get with the Quality Check summary.   
Refer to its [dedicated section](doc/qc.md).

The report is written in HTML and is supposed to be opened in a web browser.    
In the future, this tool may support other formats.  
  
When the analysis is concluded, the application will try to open the report
that has just been generated, with the "default" web browser.   
Depending on the OS context, this may not be feasible.  
This "automated" feature is turned off when the quiet mode is activated with `-q`.

When graphs are to be included in the report, its size grows significantly.    
In order to share report easily, a `--tiny-html` option is there to reduce
the report size. The reduction factor is approximately 8.  

When this option is used, the plotting (javascript) library is not included in the HTML,  
it will be retrieved from the web when the user first opens such a graph.  
Basically, the report is slower to open but smaller in size.  

Modern web browsers are cache performant, there is litterally no performance degradation
when using this option which might aswell become the standard behavior in the future.
We recommend to use it, especially if you generate a lot of reports, store them and
are interested in some of the graphs we developed.

## Basic operations

Basic operations consist in data enumeration mainly. There the only ones that only generate a Terminal output (_stdout_).

* `--header` to print the header content (as is)
* `--epochs` to enumerate encountered Epochs, in chronological order
* `--sv` to enumerate encountered Sv
* `--gnss` to enumerate encountered Constellations
* `--observables` to enumerate encountered Observables
* `--orbits` to enumerate encountered Orbit fields

For example:

```bash
rinex-cli --fp test_resources/OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O --epochs --sv
``` 

A `--pretty` option exists, to make the enumeration more readable

```bash
rinex-cli --fp test_resources/OBS/V2/KOSG0010.95O --epoch --sv --pretty
``` 

## Basic analysis

Several analysis can be stacked to the generated report,    
see their [dedicated page](doc/analysis.md).

## Pre processing

Learn all our [preprocessing algorithms](doc/preprocessing.md)
for efficient data analysis.

## File generation

Like input files, output files do not have to follow RINEX naming conventions.  
Eventually, this tool might have a file creation helper, to help the user
follow naming conventions, but it is currenly under development.

File generation applies to all the following operations

* [filtering](doc/filtering.md): create a new RINEX from the stripped RINEX content
* [merge](doc/merge.md): merge two files into a single RINEX
* [split](doc/split.md): split a file into two.

For example, let's extract G01 from this file

```bash
rinex-cli -f test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz \
    --retain-sv \
    --output g01.txt
```

Header section is simply copied and maintained.

### File generation and compression

It is possible compress data to .gz directly, if the specified `--output` 
is terminated by `.gz`.

It is also possible to convert Observation Data to CRINEX directly
* to CRINX1 if the specified `--output` is terminated by a standard YYd termination
* to CRINX3 if the specified `--output` is termined by `.crx`

In cases where CRINEX conversion is feasible, 
it is possible to stack the `.gz` compression on top of it
* YYd.gz to specify a CRNX1 + gz
* crx.gz to specify a CRNX3 + gz

Likewise, the mirror operations are feasible:

* extract `.gz` compressed data and dump it as readable
* extract a CRINEX and dump it as a readable RINEX

### File Header customization

A header section customization interface is currently under development.  
It is possible to pass custom header fields, one per `--output` flag,
to customize such section of the RINEX to be generated.

The `custom-header` flag accepts either a direct JSON description
of the `Rinex::Header` structure, or a local file containing
such a description.


## `teqc` operations

`teqc` is a well known application to process RINEX.   
Unlike teqc, this application is not capable of processing Binary RINEX ("BINEX") and 
proprietary formats in general.

Some teqc operations are supported:

- [merge](doc/merge.md) several RINEX together into a single file.
- [split](doc/split.md) given RINEX into two
- [resampling](doc/sampling.md) to reduce data quantity
- [quality check](doc/qc.md): file quality check, mainly Observations
