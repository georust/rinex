Quality Check (QC)
==================

RINEX quality check is a special mode of this tool, activated with the `--qc` option.

QC is first developed for Observation files analysis, but this tool  
will accept other RINEX files, for which it will compute basic statistical anlysis. 

QC is a well known procedure in data preprocessing. 
There are a few differences people who are very familiar with `teqc` must
take into account when using our command line interface.

## Similarities with `teqc`

We share similarities with `teqc` which will prove convenient  
to advanced "teqc" users.  Among them:

* Quick GNSS filters (`-G`, `-R`, ...) still exist
* In augmented mode, `-no_orbit X` is feasible if you know how to operate the [preprocessor](doc/preprocessing.md)
* Similar position anlysis and reporting
* Similar signals analysis and reporting

## Differences with `teqc`

Unlike teqc we are not limited to RINEX V2, V3 and V4 Observations
are fully supported.

Unlike teqc we expect the user to provide the file context
himself. We do not have the ability to browse and search for Navigation context for examples.    
Although we support as many Navigation files to be specified, when the _augmented_ mode is being activated.  
This allows for example Glonass and other NAV context to be correctly defined.
  
1. `--fp [FILE]` for the Observation file
2. `--nav [FILE1] [FILE2]..` : pass NAV contexts

We will generate products in a dedicated folder.  

The current behavior is to use the 
[product](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/tree/rinex-cli/product)
folder to generate QC reports.

Unlike teqc, we do not support BINEX nor SP3 input data/files as of today.

Unlike teqc we do not limit ourselves to the analysis of
GPS and Glonass constellations.

Unlike teqc, we have no means to detect data duplicates, therefore
such information is not reported.

Unlike teqc, we do not limit ourselves to L1/L2 analysis.  
This applies for instance to MP or DCB analyses. 

Unlike teqc, this tool allows accurate time description, down to 1 ns precision.  
For example, this would apply to

* the receiver clock drift analysis not being limited to 1ms/hour  
* precise control of averaging windows, etc..

## QC specific command line options

* `--qc-only`: ensures the tool will only perform the QCs,   
other graphs or record analysis is turned off. This is the most efficient  
QC mode.  

* `--qc-config`: pass a configuration file for QC reporting and calculations management (see down below) 

## Basic QC (No NAV)

When `--qc` is activated and `--fp` is an observation file
basically we can only study the provided signals and observations.

Preprocessing still apply, therefore all analysis are to be performed
on the data that is still left out:

```bash
rinex-cli \
    --qc-only \
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/KMS300DNK_R_20221591000_01H_30S_MO.crx
```

With `--qc-only`, the Data QC is activated and the total report is only made of the QC analysis.

Run this configuration for the most basic QC:

```bash
rinex-cli \
    -P gps,glo \
    --qc-only \
    --qc-conf rinex-cli/config/basic.json \
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz
```

`--qc-conf` is independent to `--qc` activation.   
If you activate QC without any configuration, the default configuration is used.

basic.json specifies that we want to report on a constellation basis.  
If you compare this report to the previous one

1. you get one table per constellation. We only retained GPS and Glonass in this example,   
therefore the report is made of two tables.
2. All statistical analysis are made on constellations separately and independently    
3. A "25%" statistical window is specified. "window" accepts either a Duration  
or a percentage of the file. Here we use the latter, and 25% means we will have 4 statistical  
analysis performed over the course of 6 hours, because this file is 24h long.  
4. You also have less information in this basic configuration, because most calculations are turned off

Try this configuration now:

```bash
rinex-cli \
    -F gps,glo \
    --qc-only \
    --qc-conf rinex-cli/config/basic_manual_gap.json \
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz
```

A "10%" statistical slot is specified, you get more statistical analysis because the time slot   
now spans approximately 2 hours. 
Also "manual_gap" is specified and set to "10 seconds". That means that a duration  
of 10 seconds is now considered as an abnormal gap, in the data gap analysis.  
In default configuration, there is no manual gap. That means an abnormal gap  
is any abnormal duration above the dominant epoch interval (sample rate).

When no configuration files are given, the default configuration is used

```json
TODO
```

## Advanced configurations

Now let's move on to more "advanced" configuration, in which basically all   
calculations are active and customized

```bash
rinex-cli \
    -P gps,glo \
    --qc-separate \
    --qc-conf rinex-cli/config/basic_manual_gap.json \
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz
```

## Basic QC (with NAV)

Let's go back to our basic demo and provide Navigation context:

```bash
rinex-cli \
    -P gps,glo \
    --qc-separate \
    --qc-conf rinex-cli/config/basic.json \
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz \
    --nav test_resources/OBS/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_MN.rnx.gz
```
  
Navigation context is fully taken into account in advanced calculations

```bash
rinex-cli \
    -F gps,glo \
    --qc-separate \
    --qc-conf rinex-cli/config/advanced_study.json \
    --fp test_resources/CRNX/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_30S_MO.crx.gz \
    --nav test_resources/OBS/V3/ESBC00DNK_R_20201770000_01D_MN.rnx.gz
