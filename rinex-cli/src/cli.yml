            Split RINEX into two.
            If no epoch specified (empty argument), we assume this is a merged RINEX,
            and we split at the epoch boundary.
            Example: --split
            If an epoch is specified, we split at the given epoch.
            Epoch is specified in "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" format.
            Example: --split "2000-01-01 00:00:00"
            Example: --split "2022-01-01 12:00:00"
