Scripts
=======

List of Shell scripts to operate our applications (no GUI available yet) and perform interesting tasks.

## Getting started

All scripts are intended to be executed at the base of this Git repository,
and expect the `released` binaries to have been compiled

```bash
cd georust-rinex
cargo build --release --all-features

# Now try one of the survey scripts, for example:
./scripts/GAL/mojdnk-cpp.sh
```

Surveying and other RINEX-Cli applications will generate logs that we store in a temporary logs/ folder,
so you can further inquire what happened during the process.

##Â Surveying

Field surveying (currently only static) aims at determining the position of
reference stations very precisely without a priori knowledge, so they can serve later on as reference stations for differential
positioning techniques.

We currently sort them by constellation being used in the navigation/surveying process, either
single constellations, a combination of constellations and possibly SBAS augmentation.  

When we say BRDC, it emphasizes _real time_ surveying based solely on radio messages, 
as opposed to _post-processed_ surveying which uses higher accuracy products and exhibits better results.

CGGTTS solutions are special timing oriented solutions, to compare remote clocks to one another.
