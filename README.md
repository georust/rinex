Rust tool suites to parse, analyze and process [RINEX Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX).

The [Wiki pages](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki) contain all the documentation of this project, including several examples spanning different applications of GNSS.

If you have any question or experience any problems, feel free to open an issue on Github.

## Advantages :rocket: 

- Fast :crab:
- Open sources
- Seamless Hatanaka compression and decompression
- Seamless Gzip decompression with `flate2` build option
- RINEX V4 full support
- Meteo RINEX full support
- IONEX 2D support. Partial IONEX 3D support.
- Clock RINEX partial support: to be concluded soon
- Several pre processing operations:
  - File merging
  - Time beaning 
  - Filtering.. 
- Several post processing operations
- All modern GNSS constellations
- Modern GNSS codes and signals
- Time scales: GPST, BDT, GST, UTC
- Supports many SBAS, refer to online documentation
- High precision RINEX (carrier phase micro cycle precision)
- High precision orbit support (SP3)
- Quality Check (QC): file quality and statistical analysis to help precise positioning
(historical `teqc` function).
- SPP: Single Point Positioning
- PPP: Precise Point Positioning is work in progress :warning:

## Disadvantages :warning:

- QZNSST is represented as GPST at the moment.
- We're waiting for Hifitime V4 to support GLONASST and IRNSST.   
Until then, orbital calculations on these systems are not feasible.   
In other term, positioning is not feasible and you're limited to basic analysis. 
- These tools are oriented towards the latest revisions of the RINEX format.
RINEX4 is out and we already support it. 
Some minor features in the RINEX2 or 3 revisions may not be supported.
- Our command line applications do not accept BINEX or other proprietary formats
- File production is not fully concluded to this day. We're currently focused
on RINEX post processing rather than RINEX data production. Do not hesitate to fork and submit
your improvements

## Architecture 

* [`rinex`](rinex/) is the core library 
* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) : an application dedicated to RINEX post processing.
It supports some of `teqc` operations.   
The application is auto-generated for a few architectures, download it from the 
[release portal](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/releases)

* [`sp3`](sp3/) High Precision Orbits (by IGS) 
* [`rnx2crx`](rnx2crx/) is a RINEX compressor (RINEX to Compact RINEX)
* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a CRINEX decompresor (Compact RINEX to RINEX)
* [`rnx2cggtts`](rnx2cggtts/) post processes RINEX data and resolves PVT that we
wrap in CGGTTS format which is dedicated to (remote) clock comparison 
* [`rinex-qc`](rinex-qc/) is a library dedicated to RINEX files analysis 
* [`qc-traits`](qc-traits/) declares Traits that are shared between `rinex` and `rinex-qc`
* [`sinex`](sinex/) SNX dedicated core library

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) is an application intended to generate RINEX Data
from raw uBlox GNSS receiver frames. This application is work in progress at the moment.

:heavy_check_mark: means all revisions supported   
:construction: : Work in Progress   
__CLI__ + :chart_with_upwards_trend: means the [cli app](rinex-cli/README.md) provides one or several visualizations

The [cli app](rinex-cli/README.md) accepts more than RINEX input, for example SP3 (high precision orbits) are accepted.
