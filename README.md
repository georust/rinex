Rust tool suites to parse, analyze, manipulate `RINEX` files

* [`rinex`](rinex/) files parser, this is the core library
* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a command line application to decompress CRINEX files
* [`sinex`](sinex/) files parser, core library

* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) is a command line application that intends to expose
all the core libraries capacities to the end user, in an easy-to-use and efficient fashion.
It can be used to analyze files or perform operations like `teqc`. See the **CLI**
table down below for more information.

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx) is an application (CLI) that connects to a `Ublox`
receiver and generates RINEX data quickly & easily.
It is made possible by combining the [ublox](https://github.com/lkolbly/ublox) crate
and the [rinex](rinex/) crate.

* `rnx2crx`: RINEX file compressor is currently under development

## Supported `RINEX` types

| `SINEX` (SNX)            | :construction:    |  :construction:     | :heavy_minus_sign:   |:construction: |   `SINEX` are special `RINEX`, they are managed by a dedicated [core library](sinex/)  |
| `Troposphere` (TRO)      | :construction:    |  :construction:     | :question:           |:construction: |   `Troposphere` are one possible SINEX declination |

**Production** means file generation (_to_file()_)    
**CLI** means exposed to [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) for easy parsing & quick analysis  
**UBX** means exposed to [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) for quick and easy data production from a UBLOX receiver  

:heavy_check_mark: supported   
:heavy_minus_sign: not applicable   
:sparkle: parser will work, not fully stabilized: don't expect something extraordinary   
:construction: under development: parser will fail

## Supported file format / compressions

| Format   | File name restrictions  |    Support          |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| CRINEX   | :heavy_minus_sign: | :heavy_check_mark:  | 
| Others   | :heavy_minus_sign: | Refer to first table |
| CRINEX + `gzip` | Must end with `.gz` | Compile with `--with-gzip` or uncompress yourself |
| Others + `gzip` | Must end with `.gz` | Refer to first table, compile with `--with-gzip` or uncompress yourself |
| CRINEX + `zlib` | Must end with `.Z` | :construction:  |
| Others + `zlib` | Must end with `.Z` | :construction:  |

:heavy_minus_sign: no restrictions. We can parse a  CRINEX or a IONEX named foo.txt as long as it follows the standards.      
:heavy_check_mark: natively supported   
:construction, under development  

## Record (high level) operations

| Rinex::method          | Status            | 
|------------------------|-------------------|
| `decimate_by_interval` | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `decimate_by_ratio`    | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `data_gaps`            ||
| `lli_mask_filter`      ||
| `epoch_ok_filter`      | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `epoch_nok_filter`     | :heavy_check_mark:|
| `epoch_anomalies`      ||
| `constellation_filter` |:heavy_check_mark:|
| `space_vehicule_filter` |:heavy_check_mark:|

## `teqc` special operations

|Rinex::method | Status          | 
|--------------|-----------------|
| `Merge`      | :construction:   |
| `Splice`     | :construction:  | 



## Features

* `--with-serde`   
enables `Serialization` and `Deserialization` of key RINEX structures

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/SBAS_Service_Areas.png">

* `--with-geo`   
includes the `rust::geo` crate, 
and unlocks the    
`augmentation::sbas_selection_helper()` method,
to select the most appropriate `SBAS` augmentation system for
a given (usually current..) location on Earth.
See [constellation](doc/constellation.md) for example of use.

* `--with-gzip`  
allow native parsing of .gz compressed RINEX files. Otherwise, user must uncompress manually the `.gz` extension first.

## Contributions

Contributions, raw data and tests methods are welcomed.  
There is still a lot to achieve with this lib, especially regarding the command line applications (high level usage of the library cores).

### Introducing new RINEX types

Follow the existing architecture:

* introduce `types::Type::foo`
* provide new `record::Record` declination
* create `rinex/src/foo` subdirectory and provide at least a rinex/src/foo/record.rs for the file body
* add new specific header fields if need be, define them in `rinex/src/foo`
* attach unit tests to the new `rinex/src/foo` structures & methods
* provide relevant (but truncated, to keep repo size reasonable) raw data, under `test_resources/`
* add new type to `test_resources` testbench in `tests/parser.rs`
* add a focused testbench, in `tests/foo.rs` with specific fields test

### Adding more RINEX data

* only introduce non-existing RINEX declinations
* truncate huge files to maintain a reasonable repo size 

### TODO 

- [ ] Something to do with EpochFlag::HeaderInformationFollows flag
and smart header update ?
- [ ] Cycle Slip Events ?
- [ ] NAV/GAL Orbit5/ComplexEnum: provide a flag like type for "data-source"
