Rust tool suites to parse, analyze and process [RINEX Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX).

This RINEX toolsuite is part of the [GeoRust community](https://github.com/georust),
and we aim towards advanced geodesic and ionospheric analysis.

## Advantages :rocket: 

- Fast
- Open sources
- Native Hatanaka decompression and compression
- Seamless .gzip decompression with `flate2` compilation feature
- RINEX V4 full support, that includes modern Navigation messages
- Meteo RINEX full support
- IONEX and Clock RINEX partial support, will be concluded soon
- File merging, splitting and pre processing
- Modern constellations like BeiDou, Galileo and IRNSS
- Supported time scales are GPST, BDT, GST, UTC
- Full support of Military codes : if you're working with such signals you can
at least run a -qc analysis, and possibly the position solver once it is merged 
- Supports high precision RINEX (scaled phase data with micro cycle precision)
- RINEX post processing like SNR, DCB analysis, Broadcast ephemeris interpolation,
high precision orbit interpolation (SP3)..
- RINEX-qc: statistical analysis that you can request in the "cli" application directly.
Analysis can run on modern GNSS signals and SP3 high precision data.
Emulates "teqc" historical application.
- An SPP/PPP position solver (under development), in the form of the "gnss-rtk" library that you can
summon from the "cli" application directly.

## Known weaknesses :warning:

- QZNSST is represented as GPST at the moment
- GLONASST and IRNSST are not supported : calculations (mostly orbits) will not be accurate 
- Partial SBAS support : some features are not yet available
- The command line tool does not accept BINEX or other proprietary formats
- File production is not fully concluded to this day, some formats are still not correctly supported
(mostly NAV).

## Architecture 

* [`rinex`](rinex/) is the core library 
* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) is a command line application based on the core library.  
It can be used to process RINEX files and perform operations similar to `teqc`.   
The application is auto-generated for a few architectures, download it from the 
[release portal](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/releases)

* [`sp3`](sp3/) High Precision Orbits (by IGS) 
* [`gnss-rtk`](gnss-rtk/) a position solver from raw GNSS signals.
Currently works from RINEX input data, but that is not exclusive.
* [`rnx2crx`](rnx2crx/) is a RINEX compressor (RINEX to Compact RINEX)
* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a CRINEX decompresor (Compact RINEX to RINEX)
* [`rinex-qc`](rinex-qc/) is a library dedicated to RINEX files analysis 
* [`qc-traits`](qc-traits/) declares Traits that are shared between `rinex` and `rinex-qc`
* [`sinex`](sinex/) SNX dedicated core library

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) is an application intended to generate RINEX Data
from raw uBlox GNSS receiver frames. This application is work in progress at the moment.

:heavy_check_mark: means all revisions supported   
:construction: : Work in Progress   
__CLI__ + :chart_with_upwards_trend: means the [cli app](rinex-cli/README.md) provides one or several visualizations

The [cli app](rinex-cli/README.md) accepts more than RINEX input, for example SP3 (high precision orbits) are accepted.
