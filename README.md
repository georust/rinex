## Disadvantages :warning:

- Navigation is currently not feasible with Glonass and IRNSS (applications/ ppp solver).
- QZSS navigation has not been tested yet
- Enhanced navigation with SBAS is not 100% feasible yet
- RTK (differential navigation) is not 100% feasible yet
- Our applications do not accept proprietary formats like Septentrio for example.
Some solutions may be developped in the future.
- BINEX support is currently partial and work in progress.

Getting started
===============

[Follow our tutorials](./tutorials) to get started.   

We recommend starting with basic examples and following the topics you are interested in.

Repo architecture
=================

This repo holds everything for GNSS post processing.
Including official Rust libraries, some applications,
tutorials on how to use the applications and data sets,
mostly for testing and demonstration purposes.

### Applications

* [`BIN2RNX`](bin2rnx/) is an application to collect a BINEX stream into RINEX files.
* [`CRX2RNX`](crx2rnx/) is a CRINEX decompresor (Compact RINEX to RINEX).
It is a small application that may be operated by itself, or be combined to `rinex-cli` for a complete 
processing pipeline.
* [`RINEX-Cli`](rinex-cli/) is our main application.  
It is a Cli and is not a GUI, which will be developped later (not a current pending topic).   
If you want to see a GUI version happen sooner, feel free to contact us and join the effort.   
This application combines some of `teqc` and `anubis` features.   
It allows post processed navigation like `rtklib` and integrates a special CGGTTS solutions solver.  
The analysis report is currently rendered in HTML.  
The application is auto-generated for a few architectures, you can directly
[download it from Github.com](https://github.com/georust/rinex/releases)
* [`RNX2BIN`](rnx2bin/) dumps one RINEX or CRINEX into a binary file
made of BINEX Messages.
* [`RNX2CRX`](rnx2crx/) is a RINEX compressor (RINEX to Compact RINEX).
It is a light application that you can combined to `rinex-cli` for a complete workflow.
* [`UBX2RNX`](ublox-rnx/) is an application to generate RINEX files from Ublox receivers.   
This application is currently work in progress.

### Libraries

* [`BINEX`](binex/) BINEX message Encoding and Decoding library
* [`Qc-Traits`](qc-traits/) is a low level library that is shared
between our core libraries to permit consistant behaviors.
* [`RINEX`](rinex/) provides RINEX parsing, formatting and CRINEX support.
It allows post processing of all these file formats
* [`RINEX-Qc`](rinex-qc/) is a our GNSS post processing library.
It allows considering a complex fileset of RINEX, possibly enhanced with
SP3. It generates a geodetic report from all of that.
* [`SINEX`](sinex/) is core library dedicated to this special format.
* [`SP3`](sp3/) High Precision Orbits (by IGS) parsing. 
It allows post processing for PPP.

### Other 

* [`logs`](logs/) is dedicated to store sessions log, if you work within this workspace directly.
* [`tutorials`](tutorials/) will help you get started rapidly. The environment is
compatible with the latest release.
* [`tools`](tools/) are utility scripts and development tools

RINEX-Cli
=========

`rinex-cli` is our main application. Like all applications contained in this repo, it is automatically
generated [upon Release](https://github.com/georust/rinex/releases).

`rinex-cli` supports many options that are closely tied to the [Qc options](./rinex-qc):

- `nav`: will enable post processed navigations
- `cggtts`: enables the special CGGTTS solutions
- `kml`: allows to render the PPP solutions as KML tracks
- `gpx`: allows to render the PPP solutions as GPX tracks

Make sure to read how to [activate the application logs](./tutorials/Logs.md) when
performing advanced operations.

Formats & revisions
===================

The `RINEX` lib supports RINEX V4, that includes the new navigation frames.  
It also supports IONEX and Clock RINEX in their latest revisions. 

The `SP3` lib supports rev D.

File format and applications
============================

This table summarizes all supported formats, how they are managed, what they permit,
and whether the applications supports them or not.

`Library Indexing`: gives how this dataset is indexed in the respective core library.   
`Qc Indexing`: gives how this dataset is indexed and managed by the [Qc library](rinex-qc/).  
`TimeScale`: gives what [TimeScale](https://docs.rs/hifitime/latest/enum.TimeScale.html) may be encountered 
during time domain indexing of this file format.   

:heavy_check_mark: all revisions are supported.   
:construction: : work in progress.  
__CLI__ : supported by the [Qc Library](./rinex-qc)   
__CLI__ + :chart_with_upwards_trend: [Qc Reporting](./rinex-qc) will generate one or several graphs

==============

These tools would not exist without the great libraries written by C. Rabotin, 
[check out his work](https://github.com/nyx-space).  

Some features would not exist without the invaluable help of J. Lesouple, through
our countless discussions. Check out his
