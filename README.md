Rust tool suites to parse, analyze and process [RINEX Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX).

* [`rinex`](rinex/) is the core library 
* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) is a command line application based on the core library.  
It can be used to process RINEX files and perform operations similar to `teqc`.   
The application is auto-generated for a few architectures, download it from the 
[release portal](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/releases)

* [`rnx2crx`](rnx2crx/) is a RINEX compression program 
* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a CRINEX decompression program (Compact RINEX to RINEX)
* [`sinex`](sinex/) SNX dedicated core library

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) is an application that connects to a `Ublox`
receiver and generates RINEX data quickly & easily.   
It is the combination of the [ublox](https://github.com/lkolbly/ublox)
and [rinex](rinex/) crates.

By default, all timestamps are in UTC with leap seconds correctly managed.

This RINEX toolsuite is part of the [GeoRust community](https://github.com/georust),
and we aim towards advanced geodesic and ionospheric analysis.

:heavy_check_mark: means all revisions supported   
:construction: under development   
__CLI__ + :chart_with_upwards_trend: means record analysis is supported by the CLI, [README](rinex-cli/README.md)

File formats
============

| Format                 | File name restrictions            |    Support                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| RINEX                  | :heavy_minus_sign:                | :heavy_check_mark:                 |
| CRINEX                 | :heavy_minus_sign:                | :heavy_check_mark:                 | 
| gzip compressed RINEX  | Name must end with `.gz`          | `--flate2` feature must be enabled |
| gzip compressed CRINEX | Name must end with `.gz`          | `--flate2` feature must be enabled |

:heavy_minus_sign: No restrictions: file names do not have to follow naming conventions.  

## Known weaknesses :warning:

- Glonass Time Scale is not known to this day.
We cannot parse and apply system time corrections from other time scales into the glonass time scale.
