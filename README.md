Rust tool suites to parse, analyze and process [RINEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX) and GNSS data.

The [Wiki pages](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki) contain all documentation and example applications of this toolbox.  

Use [Github Issues](https://github.com/georust/rinex/issues) to report bugs and other malfunctions.

## Advantages :rocket: 

- Fast
- Open sources: read and access all the code!
- All modern GNSS constellations, codes and signals
  - Surveying with GPS, Galileo, BeiDou and QZSS
- Time scales: GPST, QZSST, BDT, GST, UTC, TAI
- RINEX V4 full support
- Efficient seamless compression and decompression
- Most RINEX formats supported (see following table)
- High Precision Clock RINEX products (for PPP)
- High Precision Orbital [SP3 for PPP](https://docs.rs/sp3/1.0.7/sp3/)
- DORIS (special RINEX)
- Many pre-processing algorithms including Filter Designer
- Several file operations: merging, splitting, time binning (batch)

## Warnings :warning:

- The BINEX parser does not support all frames yet
- Navigation is currently not feasible with Glonass and IRNSS
- Differential navigation (SBAS, DGNSS or RTK) is not support yet
- Our applications do not accept proprietary formats like Septentrio for example
- File production might lack some features, mostly because we're currently focused on data processing

## Repository 

This library is reduced to parser libraries, previous applications have been moved to the [RTK-rs](https://github.com/rtk-rs) workspace.

* [`rinex`](rinex/) is the core library 
* [`tutorials`](tutorials/) is a superset of scripts (Linux/MacOS compatible)
to get started quickly. The examples span pretty much everything our applications allow.
* [`sp3`](sp3/) High Precision Orbits (by IGS) 
* [`binex`](binex/) BINEX Encoding and Decoding library
* [`sinex`](sinex/) SNX dedicated core library
* [`tools`](tools/) are utility scripts and development tools

Formats & revisions
===================

The parser supports RINEX V4.0, that includes RINEX V4 Navigation files.   
We support the latest revisions for both IONEX and Clock RINEX.  
We support the latest (rev D) SP3 format.
