Rust tool suites to parse, analyze and process `RINEX` files

* [`rinex`](rinex/) is the core library 
* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) is a command line application based on the core library.  
It can be used to process RINEX files or perform operations similar to `teqc`.   
The application is auto-generated for a few architectures, download it from the 
[release portal](https://github.com/gwbres/rinex/releases)

* [`rnx2crx`](rnx2crx/) is a RINEX compression program 
* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a CRINEX decompression program (Compact RINEX to RINEX)
* [`sinex`](sinex/) SNX dedicated core library

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) is an application that connects to a `Ublox`
receiver and generates RINEX data quickly & easily.   
It is the combination of the [ublox](https://github.com/lkolbly/ublox)
and [rinex](rinex/) crates.

By default, all timestamps are in UTC with leap seconds correctly managed.

## Supported `RINEX` types

| Type                       | Parser            | Writer              |  CLI                 | UBX                  |           Notes          |
|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------
| Navigation  (NAV)          | :heavy_check_mark:| Ephemeris :construction: V4 :construction: |  :heavy_check_mark: :chart_with_upwards_trend:  | :construction:       | Epoch iteration |
| Observation (OBS)          | :heavy_check_mark:| :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:  :chart_with_upwards_trend: |  :construction:  | Epoch iteration |
|  CRINEX  (Compressed OBS)  | :heavy_check_mark:| RNX2CRX1 :heavy_check_mark: RNX2CRX3 :construction:  | :heavy_check_mark:  :chart_with_upwards_trend:  |  :construction:    | Epoch iteration |
|  Meteorological data (MET) | :heavy_check_mark:| :heavy_check_mark:  | :heavy_check_mark: :chart_with_upwards_trend:  | :construction:  | Epoch iteration |  
|  Clocks (CLK)              | :heavy_check_mark:| :construction:      | :construction:   |:construction: | Epoch iteration |
|  Antenna (ATX)             | :heavy_check_mark:| :construction:      | :construction:   |:construction: | Sorted by `antex::Antenna` |
|  Ionosphere Maps  (IONEX)  | :heavy_check_mark:|  :construction:     | :heavy_check_mark:  :chart_with_upwards_trend: |:construction: | Epoch iteration |
|  SINEX  (SNX)              | :construction:    |  :construction:     | :heavy_minus_sign:   |:construction: | SINEX are special RINEX, they are managed by a dedicated [core library](sinex/)  |
|  Troposphere  (TRO)        | :construction:    |  :construction:     | :question:           |:construction: | Troposphere are one possible SINEX declination |
|  Bias  (BIA)               | :heavy_check_mark: |  :construction:    | :question:           |:construction: | Bias solutions are one possible SINEX declination |

:heavy_check_mark: means all revisions supported   
:construction: under development   
__CLI__ + :chart_with_upwards_trend: means record analysis is supported by the CLI, [README](rinex-cli/README.md)

## File formats

| Format   | File name restrictions  |    Support          |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| RINEX    | :heavy_minus_sign: | :heavy_check_mark: but refer to first table |
| CRINEX   | :heavy_minus_sign: | :heavy_check_mark:  | 
| RINEX + `gzip`   | Must end with `.gz` | Compile with `--flate2` feature, or uncompress manually first |
| CRINEX + `gzip` | Must end with `.gz` | Compile with `--flate2` feature, or uncompress manually first |
| `.Z` | :heavy_minus_sign:  | :x: |

:heavy_minus_sign: No restrictions: file names do not have to follow naming conventions.  

## Known weaknesses :warning:

- Glonass Time Scale is not known to this day.
We cannot parse and apply system time corrections from other time scales into the glonass time scale.

## Record

High level operations can be performed on RINEX records and
RINEX structure in general.
Refer to the [official Documentation](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/struct.Rinex.html).

RINEX Records vary a lot from one revision to another
and from one file type to another.
To learn how to browse the RINEX record you are interested in,
refer to its definition in the official documentation.
For example, here is the 
[Observation Record](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/observation/record/type.Record.html)
definition.

## Features

* `--serde` enables main RINEX structures serialization and deserialization 

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/SBAS_Service_Areas.png">

* `--sbas`: SBAS (stationnary augmentation systems related features).    
[selection_helper()](https://docs.rs/rinex/latest/rinex/struct.Rinex.html),
select a SBAS for a given location on Earth.

* `--flate2`  
allow native parsing of .gz compressed RINEX files. Otherwise, user must uncompress manually the `.gz` extension first.
