Rust tool suites to parse, analyze and process [RINEX Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX).

The [Wiki pages](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki) is the main documentation portal. It contains
several examples spanning different GNSS applications.

If you have any question or experience any problems, feel free to open an issue on Github.

- Open sources
- Seamless Hatanaka compression and decompression
- Seamless Gzip decompression with `flate2` build option
- RINEX V4 full support
- Meteo RINEX full support
- IONEX 2D support. Partial IONEX 3D support.
- Partial ANTEX support
- Full support of High Precision Clock RINEX products
- Full support of [SP3](https://docs.rs/sp3/1.0.7/sp3/) High precision orbit products
- Several pre processing algorithms:
  - [File merging](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/file-merging)
  - [Time binning](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/time-binning)
  - [Filtering](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/Preprocessing)
- Several post processing operations
  - [Position solver](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/Positioning)
  - [Graphical analysis](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/Graph-Mode)
  - [CGGTTS solutions solver](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/CGGTTS)
- All modern GNSS constellations, codes and signals
- Time scales: GPST, BDT, GST, UTC
- [SBAS support](https://docs.rs/gnss-rs/2.1.3/gnss_rs/constellation/enum.Constellation.html)
- High precision phase data (micro cycle precision) theoretically supported but not tested yet
- [Quality Check (QC)](https://github.com/georust/rinex/wiki/Quality-Check): file quality and statistical analysis to help precise positioning
(historical `teqc` function).

## Disadvantages :warning:

- QZNSST is represented as GPST at the moment.
- We're waiting for Hifitime V4 to support GLONASST and IRNSST.   
Until then, orbital calculations on these systems are not feasible.   
In other term, positioning is not feasible and you're limited to basic analysis. 
- These tools are oriented towards the latest revisions of the RINEX format.
RINEX4 is out and we already support it. 
Some minor features in the RINEX2 or 3 revisions may not be supported.
- Our command line applications do not accept BINEX or other proprietary formats
- File production is not fully concluded to this day. We're currently focused
on RINEX post processing rather than RINEX data production. Do not hesitate to fork and submit
your improvements

## Repository 

* [`rinex`](rinex/) is the core library 
* [`rinex-cli`](rinex-cli/) : an application dedicated to RINEX post processing.
It supports some of `teqc` operations.
It integrates a position solver and can format CGGTTS tracks for clock comparison.
The application is auto-generated for a few architectures, download it from the 
[release portal](https://github.com/georust/rinex/releases)

* [`sp3`](sp3/) High Precision Orbits (by IGS) 
* [`rnx2crx`](rnx2crx/) is a RINEX compressor (RINEX to Compact RINEX)
* [`crx2rnx`](crx2rnx/) is a CRINEX decompresor (Compact RINEX to RINEX)
* [`rinex-qc`](rinex-qc/) is a library dedicated to RINEX files analysis 
* [`qc-traits`](qc-traits/) declares Traits that are shared between `rinex` and `rinex-qc`
* [`sinex`](sinex/) SNX dedicated core library

* [`ublox-rnx`](ublox-rnx/) is an application intended to generate RINEX Data
from raw uBlox GNSS receiver frames. This application is work in progress at the moment.

Formats & revisions
===================

The core library supports parsing RINEX V4.00 and the current behavior is to fail
on higher revisions. NAV V4 is correctly supported as described in the following table.

We support the latest revisions for both IONEX and Clock RINEX.

We support the latest (rev D) SP3 format.

Special Thanks
==============

These tools would not exist without the great libraries written by C. Rabotin, 
[check out his work](https://github.com/nyx-space).  

Some features would not exist without the invaluable help of J. Lesouple, through
our countless discussions. Check out his 
[PhD manuscript (french)](http://perso.recherche.enac.fr/~julien.lesouple/fr/publication/thesis/THESIS.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3WlHm0eP7ygRzywbL07Ig-JawvsdCEdvz1umJJaRRXVO265J9cp931YyI)
