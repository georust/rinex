# `rinex-cli` for `teqc`'ies

## Introduction

This aims to be a simple tutorial for those who wish to transition away from the unsupported and closed source
UNAVCO `teqc` tool towards the newer and more powerful open source `rinex-cli`.

Although a full 1-1 replacement is not in scope, this guide should help you replace your existing scripts and take
advantage of a lot of new functionality.

## Installing rinex-cli

Prebuilt versions will eventually be supplied for direct download, but for now, you will have to build `rinex-cli` from
the source by
installing a Rust build environment like [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
Once you have that, simply run `cargo install rinex-cli`, and this will compile, build and install the latest
published
version for you.
