## Parser

`SINEX` special files parsing

[data/](data/) contains several example `SINEX files, mainly for testing purposes

Known behavior:

* this parser does not care about file naming conventions
* the parser expects proper Header and SINEX structures
* the parser only cares about the Header position
* the parser does not care about the Description / Solution order
* the parse does not care about the Description fields order, as specified by standards
