RNX2CRX
=======

These examples demonstrate the CRINEX compression and formatting capabilities
of this toolkit.

By default, the CRINEX cores use the same internal parameters as the historical `crx2rnx` program,
therefore the toolkit is totally compatible with files generated by the historical tool. 
Indeed, all the files we host in this repo were compressed using the historical program.

Our toolkit does not limit itself to a (de-)compression level of 3 like the historical tool.
You have complete control over the maximal compression order.
A compression order of 5 is said to be the optimal (following Y. Hatanaka's original paper).
But keep in mind that CRINEX is not a lossless compression when it comes to signal observations: 
the higher the compression order, the larger the error.
