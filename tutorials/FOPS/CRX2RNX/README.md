CRX2RNX
=======

These examples demonstrate the CRINEX decompression and RINEX formatting capabilities
of this toolkit.

By default, the CRINEX cores uses the same internal parameters as the historical `crx2rnx` program,
therefore the toolkit totally compatible with files generated by the historical tool.
Indeed, all the files we host in this repo were compressed using that program as well.

Our toolkit does not limit itself to a (de-)compression level of 3 like the historical tool.
You have complete control over the maximal compression order.
A compression order of 5 is said to be the optimal (following Y. Hatanaka's original paper).
But keep in mind that CRINEX is not a lossless compression when it comes to signal observations: 
the higher the compression order, the larger the error.

To decompress CRINex into readable RINex, you have two options

- either use the dedicated `crx2rnx` simplistic tool, which only performs this operation
- or use the `--crx2rnx` option of `rinex-cli` when synthesizing RINex
