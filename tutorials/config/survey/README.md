Static surveying
================

All these scripts are compatible with the `ppp` opmode and loaded via `-c`.
Refer to the wiki pages and tutorial scripts for example.

Static geodetic surveying aims at solving the coordinates of a future Reference Station,
without apriori knowledge and with high precision as possible.

These scripts use high interpolation orders, which is compatible with long periods of signal observations.  
Reduce those when working with shorter observation periods.
