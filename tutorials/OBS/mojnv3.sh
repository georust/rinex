# this is a modern V3 crinex that we directly parse.
# the report only contains its analysis (single file scenario).
# Multi GNSS RINEX being quite lengthy, it is recommended to shrink
# to the type of data you're interested in (to render faster).

# -f : force report synthesis (to always generate =single file scenario)
# -P : retain a few datasets
