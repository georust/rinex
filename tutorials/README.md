Scripts
=======

This folder will help you get started and illustrates all the capabilities of the toolbox.  
Topics are split by either opmodes or specific constellations.

Before trying to run your own processing pipeline, you should understand 
[how to load your own data into the toolbox](https://github.com/georust/wiki)

Getting started
===============

Our examples expect the binaries to have been generated with all features activated:

```bash
# download the toolbox and dataset
git clone https://github.com/georust/rinex
cd rinex

# build the tools
cargo build --release --all-features

# try one of the examples
./tutorials/GAL/mojdnk.sh
```

RINEX-Cli and other applications will generate logs but we do not store them in the following examples.  
Activate the application logs by activating the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.  
For example, this will make you see any trace

```bash
export RUST_LOG=trace
```

When working with the toolbox, use the `$GEORUST\_WORKSPACE` variable or `-w` to define your own.

Tutorials
=========

Most scripts are indexed by constellation, sometimes by signal or modulation.  
When we say `-brdc`, we want to emphasize that navigation is performed using
decoded radio message, rather than using post processed laboratory products.  

This is also sometimes referred to as "real time" surveying, because it is exactly like
navigating in real-time, except that the radio messages were stored as RINEX files, which
allows to replay them later.

`-sum` scripts emphasize that the analysis is restricted to summary report.

`CGGTTS` solutions are special timing oriented navigation solutions. Some of our surveys
are 100% dedicated to CGGTTS, sometimes we solve standard and CGGTTS solutions at the same time.
