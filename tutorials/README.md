Tutorials
=========

The tutorials serie will try to illustrate all options offered by the toolbox.

Prior running our examples, you are expected 
[to read how the two Wiki pages](https://github.com/georust/wiki)

## Geodetic reports

The [Qc (Quality Control)](./QC) reports and most broadly, _geodetic report_ 
is heavily documented and probably the most important feature
of our toolbox: 

## Filter designer

The [Filter Designer](./Filter) is critical when operating the toolbox.
It is for example the only solution to focus on some particular signals
or constellations. It is vital you learn how to operate it, especially
for PPP navigation.

## File operations

The toolbox can perform several file operations.
File operations refer to operations where we're either

1. interested in reworking on patch an input product
2. always synthesizing at least one output product.
Whether it is a RINEx, and SP3 or other format depends on the context.

Follow [this section](./FOPS) if you're interested in such operations.

## Navigation

Post processed navigation and surveying is depicted [in the related section](./NAV).

It solely relies on `rinex-cli` to this day. It depicts static and other contexts
of navigation.

## CGGTTS

The [CGGTTS](./CGGTTS) section focuses on the post processed _timing oriented_ navigation solution.

## Other

Other topics or pages that are important demonstrations:

- The [Configuration script](./CONFIG/README.md) is discussed in this page,
which also offers many configurations that these tutorials may use.

- When operating the toolbox, the log traces may prove vital.
This is particularly true for advanced operations. [The Logs page](./Logs) teaches how to
take advantage of the sessions log

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

You can also refer to our [Frequently Asked Questions](./FAQ.md) that tries to provide basic troubleshooting.  
Obviously all cases questions cannot be answered, feel free to contact us on the Discord channel.
