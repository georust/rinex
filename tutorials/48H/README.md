Two day surveying
=================

Our toolbox accepts as many RINEX as you need.  
One typical RINEX spans 24 h but that is somewhat arbitrary.  
You could load bigger RINEX that do not follow the standards without any troubles.  

In these examples, we're using two sets of official RINEX (two seperate days) that we load in a single run.  
It allows consuming more than 24h of observations.  
This is particularly useful in the static surveying application, where we want to calibrate a geodetic station
with ultimate precision.
