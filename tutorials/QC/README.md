QC tutorials
============

The default opmode of `rinex-cli` is Qc which standds for Quality Control
and generates a complete geodetic report (in HTML) to summarize the data context,
and most importantly help understand what can be achieved with it.

When no opmode is selected in `rinex-cli`, we consider the Qc report is selected
and a report will be rendered.

Keep in mind that only the actual data content may contribute to the final report. 
Let say 

The following pages describe all sections of the geodetic report:

- [QC-summary](./SUM) to get started. Focuses on the
report introduction and qc-sum option.
- [Observations](./OBS) RINEx examples
- [Meteo](./METEO) RINEx examples
- [IONEx](./IONEX) examples
- [BRDC](./BRDC) RINEx examples
- [SP3](./SP3) examples
