Navigation
==========

This section focuses on (mostly static) post processed navigation,
which can also be referred to _a posteriori_ field surveying. 
It is enabled by the `ppp` (Post Processed Navigation) option
of `rinex-cli`. 

As opposed to `File operations` for example, this section is more advanced
for several reasons

- navigation is not feasible with a single RINEx. You will always have
to create a superset prior anything.
- the topic is physically more advanced than simply processing those files
- how you can navigate and what you can achieve is highly dependent on the
input superset. We will try to teach how different supersets have to offer,
and try to depict all the toolbox behaviors on each scenarios.

- The [BRDC](./BRDC) examples focus on post processed yet radio signal
based navigation.
- The [PPP](./PPP) examples focus on precise post processed navigation,
which is not radio signal based.

Closely related to these sections, the [CGGTTS](../CGGTTS) examples are
dedicated to special timing navigation solutions.
