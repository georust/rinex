Navigation
==========

This section focuses on (mostly static) post processed navigation,
which can also be referred to _a posteriori_ field surveying. 

We obtain navigation solutions by asking for solution solving and auto-integration
in the [Qc (Quality Control) options]().

Post processed navigation is one of the most advanced option of the toolbox, for several reasons:

- Post processed navigation is not feasible with a single file and therefore,
naturally requires to master how to form a dataset correctly.
- This topic physically more advanced than simple file post processing
or post processing each file individually
- What can be achieved is highly dependent on the dataset.

- The [BRDC](./BRDC) examples focus on post processed yet radio based navigation.
- The [PPP](./PPP) examples focus on precise post processed navigation,
which is not radio based.

Closely related, the [CGGTTS](../CGGTTS) section describes these specific navigation solutions.
