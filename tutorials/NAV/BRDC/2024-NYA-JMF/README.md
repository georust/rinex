2024_128_SPITZBERG
==================

Field surveying of a glacier on the Spitzberg island. 

The objective is to determine the absolute altitude of the glacier, to study its behavior accross seasons.  
Therefore the rover is held static: this is not a dynamic RTK application.

The rover uses an F9P Ublox receiver, and the reference site uses Septentrio solutions: both profesional equipment.
