File generation
===============

`filegen` specifies we do not want to generate a geodetic report but output products instead.  

In data production (like any file operations) we have an interface to customize the data production
context, which is identical accross all file operations.

`filegen` also allows converting the RINEX data fields to CSV, which can be convenient to forward
to yet another tool in your post processing pipeline.
