BINEX is a simple library to decode and encode BINEX messages.  
BINEX stands for BINary EXchange and is the "real time" stream oriented
version of the RINEX format. It is to this day, the only open source protocol
to encode GNSS and navigation data.

While RINEX is readable and based on line termination, BINEX is real-time and
hardware orientated (at the GNSS receiver firmware level).

This library allows easy message encoding and decoding, and aims at providing seamless
convertion from RINEX back and forth.

You have two scenarios to approach a BINEX stream:

* use our Decoder object, which works on I/O interface directly
and can represent a stream of continuous of either [Message]s (open source)
or undisclosed elements. (private prototypes)

* use Message::decode to work on your own buffer directly.

##Â Message Decoding

Use the BINEX `Decoder` to decode messages from a `Readable` interface:

```rust
```

## Message forging

The BINEX library allows easy message forging. Each message can be easily encoded and then
streamed into a `Writable` interface:

```rust
```
